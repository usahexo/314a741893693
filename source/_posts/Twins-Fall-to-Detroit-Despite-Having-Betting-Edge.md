#  Twins Fall to Detroit Despite Having Betting Edge

For the first time in a long time, the Minnesota Twins found themselves on the losing side of the ledger when taking on their American League Central Division rivals from Detroit. The Tigers were able to take down the Twins by a score of 5-3, thanks in large part to a two-run homerun by Nicholas Castellanos in the bottom of the seventh inning.

The game was tight throughout, with neither team able to muster up much offense until late in the contest. That's when Castellanos put Detroit up for good, doubling the Tigers' lead and all but putting the game out of reach.

Minnesota starter Jose Berrios pitched well, allowing just two runs over six innings while striking out seven batters. However, it wasn't enough as the Twins bullpen faltered down the stretch. Michael Tonkin gave up three runs in just one inning of work, blowing his third save opportunity of the season.

It was a disappointing loss for Minnesota, who had come into the game as sizable favorites according to Las Vegas odds makers. The Twins are now just 2-4 on their current 10-game road trip and sit 5.5 games back of first place Cleveland in the AL Central standings.

#  Twins Lose Again, This Time as Underdog

It was not supposed to be this way. Coming into the season, the Twins were one of the favorites in the American League Central. They had won 85 games in 2017 and returned most of their key players. The Kansas City Royals, on the other hand, were coming off a 78-win season and were not expected to compete.

But that is exactly what has happened. The Royals have been one of the surprise teams in baseball, while the Twins have been one of the biggest disappointments. Kansas City currently sits at 34-30, just three games back of first place in the Central Division, while Minnesota is languishing at 27-37, in last place.

The Twins’ latest setback came on Tuesday night, when they lost to Kansas City as an underdog. Lorenzo Cain hit a two-run homer off Twins reliever Addison Reed in the top of the ninth inning to give KC the victory.

Minnesota has now lost six straight games and 11 of their last 12. Their only win in that stretch came on June 5th, when they defeated Detroit 7-4. The Tigers are currently in last place in the AL Central, so that victory was hardly anything to brag about.

What has gone wrong for the Twins? One issue has been their starting pitching. Ervin Santana, who won 17 games for them last year, has been inconsistent this season and currently has a 3-5 record and a 5.49 ERA. Jose Berrios, who is seen as their ace of the future, has also struggled; he is 5-5 with a 4.05 ERA. Other starters like Kyle Gibson and Lance Lynn have also not pitched up to expectations.

Meanwhile, the Royals’ starting pitching has been much better this year. Starter Danny Duffy is 6-6 with a 3.64 ERA, while newcomer Jorge Lopez is 4-3 with a 2.96 ERA. Relief pitcher Brad Boxberger has also been solid; he has an impressive 2.01 ERA in 26 appearances this season.

Offensively, both teams have been relatively equal this year. Minnesota’s batting average of .248 ranks 11th out of 15 teams in the AL Central Division, while Kansas City’s .246 average ranks 12th out of 15 teams in the AL West Division (the Royals play in a tougher division). Twins slugger Miguel Sano leads all AL hitters with 19 home runs but his batting average is only .243; meanwhile Hosmer leads all KC hitters with a .318 batting average).

So what does the rest of the season hold for these two struggling ballclubs? It’s difficult to say for sure, but it seems unlikely that either team will make a run at first place given their current form. The Royals are probably still better than Minnesota but may not be able to keep up with Cleveland or Houston down the stretch; on the other hand, Twins fans can take some solace from the fact that their team still has over 60 games left to play and could easily turn things around given some better performances from their starting pitchers

#  Twins Slip in Rankings After Poor Performance

The Twins’ disappointing season continued this week, as they fell in the rankings of several major league baseball power rankings.

ESPN’s Power Rankings had the Twins at number 19 heading into the week, but they slid all the way down to number 27 after losing two out of three games to the Kansas City Royals.

The Twins are now in last place in the American League Central Division, with a record of 38-51.

USA Today’s Power Rankings also had the Twins falling this week, from number 22 to number 27.

And Bleacher Report’s latest Power Rankings put the Twins at number 26, down from number 20 last week.

So far this season, the Twins have had trouble scoring runs and getting timely hits. Their batting average is just .236 and they have only scored 348 runs so far this year.

Their pitching staff has also been inconsistent, with a combined ERA of 4.40.

This week’s series against the Royals was a microcosm of their entire season thus far. The Twins were held scoreless in two of the three games, and only scored one run in the other game.

Despite their struggles, there is still time for the Twins to turn their season around. They are only six games out of first place in their division, and there is still plenty of baseball left to be played.

#  Twins Continue to Struggle as Sports Bettors Lose Faith

The Minnesota Twins have been one of the biggest disappointments in baseball this season. Heading into Wednesday’s games, they had the fourth-worst record in the American League and were 12.5 games out of first place. This has not been good news for sports bettors, as Twins games have not been good bets.

In fact, according to the OddsShark MLB Database, Twins games have resulted in losing wagers 58.3% of the time this season. That is by far the worst mark in baseball, as no other team has lost more than 50% of their games. Bettors who have backed the Twins throughout the year have suffered significant losses as a result.

One explanation for this poor performance is that the Twins simply do not have enough good players. Their lineup is filled with aging veterans like Brian Dozier and Eduardo Escobar, and they do not have any young stars who can carry them to victory on a nightly basis. The pitching staff is also very weak, with no standout starters or relievers. As a result, it has been very difficult for them to win games.

Another possible reason for the Twins’ struggles is that they are facing too much competition in their division. The AL Central is currently one of the strongest divisions in baseball, with four teams (the Twins included) sporting winning records so far this season. With so many good teams competing for playoff spots, it has been difficult for Minnesota to make any progress.

Whatever the reason may be, the Twins are clearly struggling and sports bettors would be wise to avoid betting on them moving forward. There are much better bets to be made elsewhere in baseball, and Twin fans should hope that their team can turn things around before it’s too late

#  Twins Can't Catch a Break as Sports Bettors Hammer Them

Minnesota may have won a world championship in 1965, but Twins baseball has been a bust in the betting market of late.

The Twins entered Tuesday’s game against the New York Mets as -170 favorites, according to OddsShark, and they promptly lost 2-1. The defeat gives Minnesota an 8-17 record in its last 25 games against the spread.

It’s been a particularly tough go for Twins fans betting on their favorite team at home. Minnesota is just 3-9 both straight up and against the spread in its last 12 games at Target Field.

There are a few reasons for the Twins' struggles. For one, they simply aren't playing very well right now. Second baseman Brian Dozier, who opened the season with an MVP-caliber campaign, has seen his production fall off dramatically in recent months. And third baseman Miguel Sano - one of the most promising young hitters in baseball - has battled injuries all year long.

But even when taking these factors into account, it's hard to make a case for why Minnesota should be such prohibitive favorites against lesser teams. The Metropolitans, who sit in last place in the National League East standings, are certainly not a powerhouse squad.

In fact, New York has actually fared better than Minnesota against winning teams this year. Against clubs that currently have winning records, the Mets are 10-8 overall and 8-6 against the spread. Meanwhile, the Twins are just 10-14 against winning opposition and 7-11 ATS.

The market seems to be overestimating Minnesota's chances of winning on any given day, which is leading to bad value for bettors backing the Twins. Until this trend changes, it might be best to avoid betting on Minnesota games altogether.
