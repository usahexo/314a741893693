#  Learn How To Read Poker Hands In Just Minutes! 

In poker, the strength of a player's hand is often times determined by the rank of each individual card. However, this isn't always the case - suits also play a role in hand ranking. In this brief article, we'll take a look at the hierarchy of poker hands and some tips on how to read them quickly and easily.

Let's start with the Royal Flush - which is unsurprisingly the highest ranking hand in poker. A Royal Flush is composed of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten from the same suit. Following this, we have four different types of Straight Flush - each one ranked lower than the last. These are:

1) Five cards of consecutive rank in the same suit (e.g. 4-5-6-7-8 of clubs) 
2) Six cards of consecutive rank in two different suits (e.g. 5-6-7-8-9 of hearts and spades) 
3) Five cards of consecutive rank in two different suits (e.g. 2-3-4-5-6 of clubs and diamonds) 
4) Four cards of consecutive rank in three different suits (e.g. 8-9-10-Joker)

After the Straight Flushes come four variations of Poker - these being Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush and Straight. The order in which they are ranked is as follows:
1) Four cards of the same rank (e.g. 4 Queens) 
2) Full House - Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank (e.g. 3 Kings and 2 Queens) 
3) Flush - Five cards all from the same suit but not all sequential (e.g.), 5 Spades ) 
4) Straight - Five sequential cards but not all from the same suit (e.g., 7 Clubs, 10 Diamonds). 

Finally, we have Three Of A Kind and Two Pair which are both ranked equally as high as each other. In fact, any hand that doesn't fit into any other category is considered to be a high card hand and is typically ranked lowest out of all possible poker hands.
