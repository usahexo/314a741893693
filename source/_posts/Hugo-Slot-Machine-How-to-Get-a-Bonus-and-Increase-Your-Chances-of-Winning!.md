#  Hugo Slot Machine: How to Win the Bonus and Increase Your Chances of Winning!

Slot machines have been around for over a century and are still one of the most popular casino games. Hugo is an online slot machine with five reels, four rows, and 40 fixed pay lines.

We will also give you some tips on how to increase your chances of winning. Let's get started!

To play Hugo, first select your bet amount by clicking on the + or − buttons next to bet. You can bet between €0.01 and €50 per spin. Once you have selected your bet amount, click on the “Spin” button to start the game. The reels will spin and eventually stop at one of the symbols. If three or more matching symbols appear on a pay line, you will win a prize. The top prize in Hugo is x750 your bet amount.

The bonus in Hugo is activated when three or more scatters (the Thors hammer) appear anywhere on the reels. When the bonus is activated, you will be taken to a new screen where you need to help Thor smash asteroids with his hammer. You can earn up to x10 your bet amount by smashing as many asteroids as possible. Be careful though, if Thor misses an asteroid, he will take a hit and lose health. If Thor runs out of health, the bonus ends and you will return to the main game screen.

Now that you know how to play Hugo, let's give you some tips on how to win the bonus and increase your chances of winning!

First, always try to max out your bet amount as this will give you the best chance of winning the top prize.

Finally, remember that luck plays a big role in slot machines so don't get too discouraged if you don't win big every time!
