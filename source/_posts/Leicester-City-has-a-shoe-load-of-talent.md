#  Leicester City has a shoe-load of talent

Leicester City surprised the world when they won the English Premier League in 2016. To the casual fan, it may not have looked like they had enough talent on their roster to compete with the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal. But what Leicester City lacked in name recognition, they made up for with their incredible team chemistry and work ethic.

Now, two years later, Leicester City is starting to look like a legitimate powerhouse in the Premier League. They currently sit in 4th place, just 2 points behind 3rd-place Liverpool. With players like Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez leading the way, Leicester City has proved that they can compete with anyone in the Premier League.

It's clear that Leicester City has a lot of talent on their roster. But can they win the Premier League again this year? Only time will tell…

After knocking out Manchester City in the previous round, Leicester City was up against it again as they took on Tottenham Hotspur in the semifinals of the English Football Association (FA) Cup. Spurs had not lost a match at home in the FA Cup in 26 games and were favorites to win the match and advance to the finals, but Leicester did not care.

Leicester came out flying and were rewarded with an early goal from Jamie Vardy in the 10th minute. Spurs tried to respond, but goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was equal to every challenge. In the second half, Leicester doubled their lead when Riyad Mahrez scored in the 59th minute. Spurs continued to create chances, but were unable to score.

The victory sends Leicester City into their first-ever FA Cup final where they will face either Arsenal or Aston Villa.

#  Blackjack: Leicester City style 

On the last day of the January transfer window, Leicester City completed the signing of Nigerian striker Kelechi Iheanacho from Manchester City for a reported £25 million. The 20-year-old had been surplus to requirements at the Etihad Stadium and was allowed to leave after two years of being blocked by Sergio Agüero in the pecking order. Iheanacho has since gone on to become a key player for Leicester, scoring 9 goals in all competitions so far this season.

One of these goals came on Saturday as Iheanacho helped Leicester to a 3-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley Stadium. The former Manchester City man demonstrated his clinical finishing ability by slotting past Hugo Lloris with a superb finish into the top corner. This goal capped off an excellent all-round performance by Iheanacho, who also impressed with his hold-up play and link-up play.

It is safe to say that Iheanacho has slotted seamlessly into Leicester’s Premier League title-winning side from 2016/17. This is in no small part due to the similarities between Leicester’s system and Pep Guardiola’s tactics at Manchester City. Both teams like to keep the ball on the ground and play out from the back, which allows young players like Iheanacho to express themselves and find space in dangerous areas.

This style of play is a world away from the long ball football often played in the Premier League, and it is no surprise that Iheanacho has thrived in such an environment. He now looks set to score many more goals for Leicester City and help them secure another top-half finish in the Premier League.

#  The odds are in Leicester City's favour

Leicester City are one of the most successful clubs in English football. They have won two League Championships, one FA Cup, one League Cup and one Community Shield. However, they have never won the Premier League. This season, they had odds of 5000-1 to win the Premier League, but they managed to do it. Here are some of the reasons why their odds were so high:

- They are a small club
- They have a new manager
- Other teams have more money and better players

Despite these disadvantages, Leicester City were able to win the Premier League thanks to their team spirit, hard work and determination. Their captain, Wes Morgan, was an important part of their success. He was a leader on and off the pitch and played an important role in keeping the team together. The other players also played their part; from Jamie Vardy's goals to Riyad Mahrez's assists, everyone contributed something to help Leicester City win the title.

It has been a fantastic season for Leicester City and their fans. They have defied all the odds and shown that anything is possible if you work hard enough.
