#  Wolves Win in Wild Rockabilly Showdown!

In an epic matchup on a hot July night, the Wolves emerged victorious against their cross town rivals, the Rockabilly Boys. This was a hardfought game that came down to the wire, with each team scoring late in the fourth quarter to make it a one possession game.

The Wolves were led by their dynamic duo of Austin and Rachel. Austin had a big night, scoring 28 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. Rachel added 15 points and 5 assists. Together, they were too much for the Rockabilly Boys to handle.

The game was close throughout, with neither team able to pull away. The Wolves led by 5 heading into halftime, but the Rockabilly Boys came out firing in the second half and took the lead early in the fourth quarter.

But Austin and Rachel would not be denied. They led a furious comeback, scoring 9 points in the final 2 minutes to put the Wolves back in front. And with a clutch free throw from Rachel, they secured the win and moved one step closer to playoff glory.
