#  Who are the particular financial backers from Nevada casino for Prop 1 IDAHO Rox Casino?

Some of the particular key players behind Idaho's Rox casino ballot measure are known, but their identities have been kept secret by the campaign.

On October 2, the Associated Press reported that billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, contributed $10 million to the campaign to support Prop 1, the measure that would allow the construction of a new casino in Southwestern Idaho. The Las Vegas Sands chairman and CEO has not hidden his opposition to gambling expansion measures in other states, but this is his first foray into a campaign in his home state of Nevada.

Adelson is not the only high-profile financial backer of Rox Casino. A September 20 article in the Idaho Press-Tribune identified two others: Tim Crandall, CEO of Sun Valley-based Crandall Associates Inc., and Steve Wynn, chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts Ltd.

Crandall was an early supporter of the measure and has given $1 million to the pro-casino campaign. Wynn came on board later, contributing an additional $500,000. Both men have business interests in Idaho; Crandall's company does engineering work for power plants and other industrial projects in the state, while Wynn's resorts operate in Reno and near Boise.

The names of other donors have not been released, but it's clear that Rox Casino has some deep pockets behind it. If approved by voters on November 6, the new casino would be a major boon to Idaho's economy, creating more than 1,000 jobs and generating millions of dollars in annual revenue for state coffers.

#  Casino Gambling Backers Pump $10M Into Idaho Race

Casino gambling proponents have poured more than $10 million into the race for Idaho’s open governor seat, according to campaign finance disclosures filed this week.

Adelson and his wife, Miriam, gave $5 million to the Idaho Jobs Coalition, a political action committee that is supporting GOP Lt. Gov. Brad Little in the May 15 primary. The couple also gave $1 million last year to a similar group backing Little’s bid to become governor.

Meanwhile, casino magnate Steve Wynn has contributed nearly $2 million to a super PAC supporting Democrat A.J. Balukoff in the race to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Butch Otter.

Wynn is seeking approval from state gambling regulators in Massachusetts for his company’s plan to build a resort casino in the Boston suburb of Everett. The $2 million he has given the Idaho Values Coalition is believed to be the largest individual donation ever made in an Idaho election.

Balukoff, a businessman from Boise, said he welcomes contributions from anyone who supports his policies, but added that he doesn’t agree with gambling on everything.

“I think it would be a mistake for Idahoans to legalize all forms of gambling, but I do support some gaming as a way to generate revenue for our state and create jobs,” Balukoff said in a statement Wednesday.

Little did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.

Idaho is one of six states without any form of legal casino gambling, although there are tribal casinos in some areas. Lawmakers came close last year to approving a measure that would have allowed up to Twin Falls County two casinos, but the proposal failed after opponents raised concerns about increased addiction and crime rates.

#  Adelson, Jacobs Lead Funding for Idaho Casino Measure

Adelson and Jacobs, who Forbes estimates are worth a combined $32.9 billion, contributed the lion’s share of the money raised to support the ballot measure. So far, they have given more than $17 million to the campaign.

The two casino moguls are no strangers to spending big to influence elections. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, were the top donors of the 2016 election cycle, contributing more than $93 million to political campaigns. Jacobs has been a big player in California politics, spending millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign donations.

If approved by voters in November, the new casino would be located in an area south of Boise that has been designated as a tribal gaming zone by the federal government. The proposed casino would be owned and operated by the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, which has about 2,000 members.

Opponents of the measure have raised about $1 million so far, including contributions from two Indian tribes that currently operate casinos in Idaho.

#  Casino Developer Gives $5M to Campaign for Idaho Gambling Measure

Developer of a new casino in south-central Idaho has donated nearly $5 million to a campaign seeking to pass a referendum allowing gambling in the state.

The donation from the Coeur d’Alene Tribe was announced Monday. It’s the largest private contribution to an Idaho political campaign on record.

The tribe is seeking approval to build a new casino near Lewiston. If the referendum passes, it would be the first casino in Idaho.

The tribe says the new casino would create 1,000 jobs.

Opponents of gambling say it could lead to addiction and other social problems.

#  Idaho Casinos: Gaming Industry Spending Big to Pass Proposition 1

The gambling industry in Idaho is about to boom. Casino operators are spending millions of dollars in an effort to pass Proposition 1, a measure that would legalize video gaming terminals (VGTs) in the state.

The proposal has generated heated debate, with opponents arguing that the terminals will prey on the state’s vulnerable population and increase crime rates. Supporters, meanwhile, maintain that the VGTs will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state.

Idaho is one of several states that have legalized VGTs in recent years. In 2017, Pennsylvania became the first state to do so, followed by West Virginia and Michigan. Louisiana and Arkansas are among the states that are currently considering similar proposals.

The rapid expansion of VGTs is fueled in part by the increasing popularity of online gambling. In contrast to traditional casino games like blackjack and craps, online gambling can be played from home using a personal computer or mobile device. Casino operators see VGTs as a way to lure customers back into their physical locations.

The gaming industry has already been busy pumping money into lobbying efforts in support of Proposition 1. According to records from the Idaho Secretary of State, over $1 million has been donated by casino operators and related groups since January 2019 alone. The Idaho Gaming Association has contributed more than $380,000, while Caesars Entertainment has given nearly $280,000.

Supporters of Proposition 1 have also been active in getting out the vote. Last week, a group calling itself “Vote Yes for Jobs” sent a mailer to residents of Ada County urging them to vote for the measure. The mailer features images of people working at various jobs, including a woman welding metal brackets and a man stacking boxes at a warehouse. The text beneath the images reads: “These jobs could be yours if we legalize video gaming terminals!”

Despite all the money being thrown around, it’s not clear if Proposition 1 will pass on November 5th. A poll from earlier this year showed that 54% of residents opposed the proposal, while only 36% supported it.
