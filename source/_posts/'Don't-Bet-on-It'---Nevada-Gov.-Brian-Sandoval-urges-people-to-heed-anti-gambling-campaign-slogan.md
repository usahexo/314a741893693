#  'Don't Bet on It' - Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval urges people to heed anti-gambling campaign slogan

CARSON CITY, Nev. — Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval is urging people to heed the state's long-standing slogan against gambling: "Don't Bet on It."

Sandoval, a Republican, told reporters Tuesday that the state is in the midst of an $11.5 billion budget shortfall and needs to shore up its education system and other critical services.

He says that while he understands the temptation to gamble, residents should resist it because the odds are not in their favor.

Nevada is one of six states with no casinos, and it relies heavily on gambling taxes and fees to fund state government operations.

The governor's comments come as southern Nevada casino operators are pushing for state lawmakers to allow them to offer more types of table games.

#  Campaign Uses Slogan 'When the C ceases, So Does Gambling'

The Stop Predatory Gambling Campaign announced a new advertising slogan and website today. The campaign's goal is to stop legalized gambling in the state, which they say preys on the poor and addicted.

"When the C ceases, so does gambling," the campaign said in a statement, referring to the letter "C" as shorthand for casino gambling.

The website Ceases.org features videos of people affected by gambling addiction, along with statistics about how much money is spent on casinos each year. It also includes a petition to lawmakers to stop predatory gambling.

The campaign's leader, Reverend Kenneth Dupree, says that casinos are "destroying families and communities."

"Casinos are targeting our poorest citizens with predatory practices, while lawmakers look the other way," Dupree said in a statement. "It's time to put an end to this before more people lose their homes, savings and lives."

Dupree founded the Stop Predatory Gambling Campaign in January of this year after leaving his previous post as pastor of a church in Biloxi, Mississippi that was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.

#  Alberta Lottery adopting 'anti-gambling when the C ceases slogan

The Alberta lottery is adopting a new slogan - "anti-gambling when the C ceases." The change is in response to the increasing popularity of gambling, with the number of people who admit to gambling at least once a week increasing by almost 50% in the past decade.

"We wanted to create a message that would resonate with our players," said a spokesperson for the lottery. "With so many alternatives available, we don't want people to gamble away their hard-earned money."

The new slogan will be rolled out over the next few months and will be included in all advertising and marketing materials.

#  Manitoba Lotteries urging players to heed anti-gambling campaign slogan

Manitoba Lotteries is urging players to heed its latest anti-gambling campaign slogan: "It's just not worth it."

The cautionary message is being promoted in an effort to help players avoid potential financial hardship.

"Gambling can be addictive and lead to significant financial problems," said Andrea Kowal, vice-president of marketing and communications for Manitoba Lotteries. "We want our players to know that it's just not worth it – the consequences can be devastating."

Statistics Canada reports that, in 2015, Canadians lost nearly $24 billion gambling – an amount equivalent to about $1,000 per person. Manitoba Lotteries wants to help reduce that figure by encouraging responsible gambling habits.

"There are many ways to have fun and enjoy spending time with family and friends without risking your hard-earned money," Kowal said. "Our goal is to help our players make informed choices and keep more money in their pockets."

The "It's just not worth it" campaign will run throughout the year in a variety of formats, including television, radio, digital and print ads.

#  OLG launches Thunder Bay anti-gambling campaign with new slogan

Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) has announced a new advertising campaign in Thunder Bay, Ontario. The campaign’s slogan is, “Play Responsibly. Have Fun. But Don’t Gamble Away Your Future.”

The impetus for the campaign is the growing number of people in Thunder Bay who are addicted to gambling. OLG spokesperson Tony Bitonti said that the goal of the campaign is to educate people about the risks associated with gambling and to encourage them to gamble responsibly.

Thunder Bay Councillor Andrew Foulds welcomed the campaign, but he also urged OLG to do more to help people who are addicted to gambling. Foulds said that OLG should provide more treatment programs for people with gambling addiction and that it should also fund research on the effectiveness of those programs.

So far, there is no evidence that OLG’s new campaign will be successful in reducing the number of problem gamblers in Thunder Bay. However, there is some evidence that campaigns like this can be effective in changing people’s behaviour. In a study published in The Lancet, researchers found that a TV advertising campaign in England reduced the number of problem gamblers by 14%.

It will take time to determine whether or not OLG’s new campaign is successful in Thunder Bay, but it is important to remember that gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for individuals and their families.
